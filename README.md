# ICRA Computer Vision Project


# Agriculural Application of Computer Vision (Object Detection and Counting)

ðŸŒ± A client of ICRA needed an automatic process of counting agricultural produce to save time, operational costs, and improve accuracy. 

## Environment Variables

1. You will need a Colab Pro subscription to access Google's GPU. 
2. To annotate images and create the image files required for the model training process, you will need to log in to your Roboflow Account, select the relevant project, and annotate.

## Deployment

This project is in progress, as newer versions will be created. 

## Run Locally

To run this project, you will need to access and run the 
`icra_TFOD_Segmentation.ipynb` which contains all the relevant code for inferencing.

If you need to train a model from scratch, you will need to run the `!{command}` line in the colab notebook. 
All code contains clearly commented instructions that you can easily follow.
